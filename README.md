# Options-Trading-Project

So this project involves a bot sort of a thing where I used data of Nvdia from 2020-2022 to train my model using Xgboost. I basically predicted option volatility using data of stock and and option chain. Then I trained predicted volatility for year 2023. I then compared that with volatility from market and according went long or short. I then hedged using delta hedging which I calculated using a basic Black Scholes model formula.
